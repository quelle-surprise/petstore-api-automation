I chose Allure as a tool for displaying test results for task.

Why ALlure?
- It's really lightweight open source framework that provides clear graphical report.
- Really easy to use, couple of dependencies needed for Java
- Good cooperation with JUnit5, in really cool way with some annotations our test report could be beautified.
- Test report is generate as html file, it's also served wia web server, so it can be really attached to any CI/CD pipeline.
- Good support for almost every CI/CD tool, there's plugin for Jenkins as well :)
